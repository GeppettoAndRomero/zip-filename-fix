/**
 * Fix mojibake (garbled) filenames in a .zip, in the browser (@zip.js/zip.js).
 *
 * The classic bug: a zip made on Japanese Windows stores filenames as CP932/Shift_JIS
 * WITHOUT the UTF-8 flag (general-purpose bit 11). Read elsewhere, the bytes are
 * misdecoded and you get mojibake. This re-decodes such names as Shift_JIS and rewrites
 * the archive with the UTF-8 flag set. File CONTENTS are copied unchanged.
 *
 * Important: names already stored as UTF-8 are left exactly as-is (no double-decode).
